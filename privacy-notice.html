                    <p>Most of the personal information we process is provided to us directly by you for one of the following reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Direct interactions: by using our website, filling in forms or by corresponding and communicating directly with us by post, phone, email, in person or otherwise,</li>
                        <li>Automated technologies or interactions: as you interact with us, we may automatically collect usage data and technical data about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We use the information in order to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Respond to your enquiries,</li>

                        <li>Send you marketing communication.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Under the UK Data Protection Act 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and applicable legislation, the lawful bases we rely on for processing this information are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>(a) Your consent,</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>(b) We have a contractual obligation,</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>(c) We have a legal obligation,</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>(d) We have a legitimate interest.</strong></li>

                    <h2>How we store your personal information</h2>
                    <p>We take commercially reasonable efforts to protect against unauthorised access to or use of your personal data. Your information is securely stored.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those who have a business need to know.</p>

                    <h2>International transfers</h2>
                    <p>Some data processors and third parties that we use are based outside the United Kingdom, so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the United Kingdom, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it.</p>
